    <string name="user_manual">User Manual</string>
    <string name="user_manual_text"><b>1. Users</b>\n<b>1.1. Target audience</b>\nCirculatio is mainly targeted to people
        who must sit for extended periods of time without the ability or habits to exercise their
        legs occasionally. The target user of Circulatio must be in a good health; meaning that users
        must not belong to any vulnerable groups of people (see the following section <i>1.2 Users outside
            of target audience</i>) and they must be in full control of themselves.\n\n
        <b>1.2. Users Outside of Target Audience</b>\nSince Circulatio is not a medical device, it was not
        tested clinically and hence it should not be used by vulnerable groups of people which
        specifically include:\n 1. People who cannot identify pain level in their leg.\n
        2. People with active leg injuries.\n
        3. Pregnant women.\n
        4. People younger than 18 years old.\n
        5. People with severely reduced mental skills.\n
        If you are not sure whether you are advised to use Circulatio, please consult your doctor or at least
        talk with a pharmacist.\n\n
        <b>2. User interaction</b>\n
        <b>2.1. Core Interaction with the Device</b>\n
        Circulatio aims to provide an intuitive design which requires minimal interaction with the
        device itself. Steps to use Circulatio:\n
        1. Putting the device on.\n
        2. Adapting the device to your leg size.\n
        3. (App) Selecting the desired vibration type, intensity and massage length via app.\n
        4. (App) Pressing the \'Start\' button to start the device.\n
        5. (App, Optional) Pausing the massage and resuming the massage again.\n
        6. (App) Pressing the \'Stop\' button which turns the device off and returns it into initial position.\n
        7. Taking the device off.\n
        If you need any assistance while using the device, please also show this user manual to the person who assists you.\n\n

        <b>2.2. Physical activity and Circulatio</b>\n
        Even though Circulatio improves blood circulation, it cannot be used to substitute or reduce
        healthy physical activity. Users should maintain the same level of physical activity (or ideally
        increase their physical activity after observing one\'s long sedentary time) which they had
        before starting to use Circulatio. By physical activity we refer to exercising, walking, running,
        stretching one\'s legs and other similar activities. These activities not only improve person\'s
        blood circulation but also provide other health benefits such as strengthen your joins, improve metabolism,
        reduce risk of various diseases, improve mental health and mood, etc, which Circulatio obviously cannot provide.
